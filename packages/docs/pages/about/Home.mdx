Neptune is the Design System built by and used at TransferWise. This is the Neptune framework for Web. The React components and CSS provide a way to build high quality, consistent user experiences on the web with ease.

## Setup

The React components and CSS are distributed separately as npm packages. Currently the React components requires [Transferwise Bootstrap](https://github.com/transferwise/bootstrap). We are working towards breaking this requirement.

Get started now by following the [setup guide](/about/Setup).

## Components

Neptune Web provides many components, ranging from a simple Button to more complex components like Typeahead or Flow Navigation. Browse all our [components](/components/Accordion), or feel free to raise an issue or contribute if there's something else you'd like to see.

## CSS

Neptune Web CSS comprises core foundational styles like typography, colours and spacing, and a number of utility classes for layout, display and more. It exposes a number of custom properties at the `:root`, which you can use in your application. These are documented under [Tokens](/styles/tokens/Colors).

## Usage guidelines

Platform agnostic usage guidelines are available on [Github](https://github.com/transferwise/neptune). If you have questions or comments on component usage you can raise them [there](https://github.com/transferwise/neptune/issues).

export const meta = {
  name: 'Neptune Web',
  linkText: 'Home',
};
